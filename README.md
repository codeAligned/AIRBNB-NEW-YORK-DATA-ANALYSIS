3.Are the demand and prices of the rentals correlated?  
4.What are the different types of properties in NYC? Do they vary by neighborhood?  
5.What localities in NYC are rated highly by guests?  
6.What makes a host Super host?  
7.Do regular hosts and super hosts have different cancellation and booking policies?  
8.Are there any common themes that can be identified from the free-text section of the reviews? What aspects of the rental experience do people like and what aspects do they abhor?
